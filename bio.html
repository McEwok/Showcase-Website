			<h1>Bio</h1>
			<p>I have loved music all my life.  I grew up with music in my home.  I grew up with a mom that listened to country music and a dad
				that listened to jazz and easy listening music.  To say the least I was exopsed to two different sides of the musical spectrum.  In
				fifth grade, I started to learn the violin.  I learned to love classical music.  By eighth grade, I discovered rap music.  I spent
				hours drawing graffiti and listening to Bone Thugz and Harmony.  At eighteen I started living the hip hop life and spent many years
				doing so.  I pretty much wasted ten years of my life.  It took me another two years after my divorce to get my life back together.
				While dating my wife, she introduced me K Love Radio.  It plays all christian music.  I learned how to do music production down in
				California when I lived there.  I also know how to rap and write rhymes.  I decided to create gospel rap.  My goal is to get the
				message out about our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
